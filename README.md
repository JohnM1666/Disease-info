# Disease-info
The Disease Information Website is a comprehensive platform built using Django, designed to provide detailed and categorized information on various diseases. The site is segmented into four main sections: By Category, By Symptom, By Medicine, and All Diseases. Each section allows users to search and access specific information based on their needs. The platform emphasizes user education and awareness while including disclaimers to encourage professional medical consultations. This synopsis details the project's background, literature review, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
The goal of this project is to create an extensive, user-friendly repository of disease-related information. This website will serve as an educational resource for the general public, providing detailed information about diseases, their symptoms, and the medicines used for their treatment. By categorizing diseases in multiple ways, users can find information that is relevant to their specific needs more efficiently.
